# G3-Dungeon-Generator
This is a simple 2D dungeon generator for Godot 3. It is an adaptation of [a Godot 2.1 dungeon generator by Michael Henderson]( https://bitbucket.org/signalsin/godot-dungeon-generator/src/master/). It is public domain like the original.

This adaptation has a **useViewportSize** bool to toggle between using the viewport size as the size of the dungeon (original behaviour) or using the size set in a **dungeonSize** Vector2.
